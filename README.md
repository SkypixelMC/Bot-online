# Bot-online
A source code that turns your bot online

### About:
This framework is meant to be used on the SkyLand production servers. The main
goal of this code is to set your Discord Bot online. This won't be effective if
you decide to host this on somewhere else. As longest you have an issue, it
could be the host your using.

This project was originally inspired by Dark Thunder, edited/fixed by Blazerd & Blqtancy.

### TO DO:
   - Download the files/source code
   - Go to https://repl.it/ (make sure to login or create an account)
   - Once your logged/signed in, click on "New repl"
   - It will tell you on what language to put, click on "python" since
   this is the language it was built for (it will tell you also if you wanna make your repl project private or public which that's your choice)
   - Click on "Create repl" and you should be able to see your project (if you don't see it, click on the top left bar and go to "my repls")
   - Go to your new project and upload the source code (unzip the file)
   - Once you done that, go to the `.env` file and it will tell you to put a `TOKEN` of your bot
   - Paste your Discord Bot token there and click on the`Run` button and your bot should be able to be online

# NOTICE
Please note that once your bot is online, it won't last long until it goes offline every 10 minutes
